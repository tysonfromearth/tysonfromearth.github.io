Hi, I'm Tyson Bryant! I am a software engineer, web developer, and data analyst. I have bachelor's degrees in Computer Science from Oregon State University and Asian Studies from Utah State University. Between degrees I studied psychology and nuclear engineering for two years apiece. I have worked as a researcher for a non-profit and for Oregon State's Radiation Center. I am motivated by the desire to improve society, educate people, and provide solutions to society's most pressing challenges such as transitioning to sustainable energy.

I want to earn a disposable income and carve out leisure time so I can finish my martial arts training, play guitar and harmonica, write, and game with friends.
